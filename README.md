[00:23.19] If you can summon the strength, tow me
[00:31.85] I can't hold down the urgency
[00:39.54] You've got to make your descent slowly
[00:48.14] And oil up those sticky keys
[01:02.14] 
[00:57.54] Coax me out, my low
[01:01.44] And have a spin of my propeller
[01:16.94] 
[01:21.79] It's a necessary evil
[01:30.24] No cause for emergency
[01:38.01] Borrow the beak of a bald eagle
[01:46.27] Oh, momentary synergy
[01:56.77] 
[01:55.72] Coax me out, my low
[01:59.32] Sink into tomorrow
[02:03.84] Coax me out, my low
[02:07.86] And have a spin of my propeller
[02:23.36] 
[02:29.77] My propeller won't spin
[02:33.49] And I can't get it started on my own
[02:38.68] When are you arriving?
[02:49.68] 
[02:42.13] My propeller won't spin
[02:46.42] And I can't get it started on my own
[02:51.68] When are you arriving?
[03:02.68] 
[02:55.28] My propeller won't spin
[02:59.50] And I can't get it started on my own
[03:04.70] When are you arriving?
[03:15.70] 
[03:08.26] My propeller
